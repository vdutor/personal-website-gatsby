Hi! Welcome to my website!

I graduated as a Computer Science Engineer from Ghent
University in 2017, where I specialized in software development and
machine learning. I'm originally from Belgium but moved to Cambridge
UK to work for Prowler.io. I am a Machine Learning Researcher in the
probabilistic modelling team, mainly working on cutting-edge
Gaussian Process based models.
